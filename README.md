## Integrating Excel and ChatGPT

Various simple tools (under development) to explore integration of Excel and ChatGPT. 

The CHATX function (written in VBA) is a basic function that passes the function's argument to ChatGPT and returns ChatGPT's response. The argument can be text or can be a cell reference to a prompt.
The CHATSHORT function (also in VBA) attempts to force ChatGPT to return a concise response. For example, a prompt of "What is the capital of Alabama?" should return simply "Montgomery". 
The CHATSENT function (VBA) returns the sentiment of text in an Excel cell. Returns a value of Positive, Neutral, or Negative.
